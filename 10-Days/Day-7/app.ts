// **Question 19:** Dinner Guests: Use one of your programs from Exercises 14 through 18 to print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.

let dinnerInvite : string[] = ["Zain", "Taha", "Abdul Rehman", "Saim", "Aneeq"]
console.log(`I am inviting ${dinnerInvite.length} people to dinner.`);

// **Question 20:** Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries: string[] = ["Japan", "Canada", "New Zealand", "Iceland", "Switzerland"];
console.log("Countries I'd like to visit:", countries);

// **Question 21:** Think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.

let book: { title: string; author: string; yearPublished: number } = {
    title: "The Hobbit",
    author: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
    yearPublished: 1937
};
console.log(`Book Info: ${book.title} by ${book.author}, published in ${book.yearPublished}`);
